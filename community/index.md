The OSIRIS framework is a fully relativistic particle-in-cell code with widespread use in the academic community developed by the team coordinating this project. It is used by over 40 research groups worldwide, and it contributed to over 400 publications in leading scientific journals. It is our goal with this open-source project to further extend our community to other users in science and industry and to provide an open simulation platform that will be the worldwide reference for kinetic plasma simulations, in terms of usability, features, and exascale level performance.
