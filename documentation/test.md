This section configures particle species boundary confition setting and must be present in the input file. 
One of these sections must exist for every species we intend to use. It accepts the following data: * 
'''type'''(2, x_dim), character(*), default = "---" * 
'''uth_bnd'''(3,2,x_dim), float, default = 0.0 * 
'''ufl_bnd'''(3,2,x_dim), float, default = 0.0 * 
'''thermal_type'''(2, x_dim), string, default = "thermal" '''type''' specifies the boundary conditions to use for the particle species. type(k,i), with k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the boundary condition in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary. The following are valid values for type: * "axial" - Axial boundary condition for 2D cylindrical coordinates. * "absorbing" or "open" - Absorbing boundary conditions. * "specular" or "reflecting" - Specular reflection boundary conditions. * "thermal" - Thermal bath boundary conditions. See ''uth_bnd'' and ''ufl_bnd'' for details. If periodic boundaries or a moving window has been specified for a given direction then type is ignored for that direction. '''uth_bnd''', '''ufl_bnd''' - specify the parameters for the thermal bath boundary conditions. When using a thermal bath boundary condition any particle crossing the specified boundary is reinjected into the simulation at its previous position using the specified thermal spread (uth_bnd) and fluid velocity (ufl_bnd). Like the velocities parameters in the species section these are specified as proper velocities i.e. gamma * v in units of c, and the same comments apply. uth_bnd(j,k,i) and ufl_bnd(j,k,i), with j = {1..3}, k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the j component of the thermal and fluid velocities respectively in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary. if type(k,i) is not set to "thermal" the values specified are silently ignored. '''thermal_type''' - specifies the type of thermal distribution to be used for thermal boundary conditions. thermal_type(k,i), with k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the thermal distribution type in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary. Possible values are: * ''"thermal"'' - Use a half maxwellian distribution for the velocity component perpendicular to the wall and use the standard classical (Maxwell) exponential distribution for all other components. * ''"waterbag"'' - Waterbag distribution * ''"random dir"'' - Random direction distribution, using absolute value of vth In all cases the resulting velocity component perpendicular to the wall will point inwards. Here's an example of an spe_bound section for a 2D run that sets the the boundary conditions in the x1 direction to absorbing boundaries and in the x2 direction to thermal bath boundaries. The thermal velocities for the boundaries in the x2 direction are set to (0.1,0.1,0.1) on the lower boundary and to (0.001,0.001,0.001) on the upper boundary. spe_bound { type(1:2,1) = "open", "open", type(1:2,2) = "thermal", "thermal", uth_bnd(1:3,1,2) = 0.1,0.1,0.1, ufl_bnd(1:3,2,2) = 0.001,0.001,0.001, } = Old Version = This is the file format used in releases up to r594\. All users are urged to upgrade their input files to the new version as soon as possible. This section of the documentation will be removed in the near future. * '''type'''(2, x_dim), integer, default = 0 * '''pth_bnd'''(3,2,x_dim), float, default = 0.0 * '''pfl_bnd'''(3,2,x_dim), float, default = 0.0 * '''thermal_type'''(2, x_dim), string, default = "thermal" '''type''' specifies the boundary conditions to use for the particle species. type(k,i), with k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the boundary condition in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary. The following are valid values for type: * 5 - Absorbing boundary conditions * 40 - Specular reflection boundary conditions * 50 - Thermal bath boundary conditions. See pth_bnd and pfl_bnd for details. If periodic boundaries or a moving window has been specified for a given direction then type is ignored for that direction. '''pth_bnd''', '''pfl_bnd''' - specify the parameters for the thermal bath boundary conditions. When using a thermal bath boundary condition any particle crossing the specified boundary is reinjected into the simulation at its previous position using the specified thermal spread (pth_bnd) and fluid velocity (pfl_bnd). Like the velocities parameters in the species section these are specified as proper velocities i.e. gamma * v in units of c, and the same comments apply. pth_bnd(j,k,i) and pfl_bnd(j,k,i), with j = {1..3}, k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the j component of the thermal and fluid velocities respectively in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary. if type(k,i) is not set to 50 the values specified are silently ignored. '''thermal_type''' - specifies the type of thermal distribution to be used for thermal boundary conditions. thermal_type(k,i), with k = {1,2} and i = {1, ..., x_dim} specifies the thermal distribution type in the i direction for the lower (k=1) or upper (k=2) boundary.
