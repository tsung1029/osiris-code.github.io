The goal of the open-source OSIRIS project is to provide a large user base with a flexible software framework to study a variety of physics problems within high energy density plasma science, plasma-based acceleration, space and astrophysics, the nonlinear optics of plasmas, QED and other exotic plasmas, and high-intensity laser and beam plasma interactions. The OSIRIS Consortium will be the entity that helps to coordinate the continued development of OSIRIS and to ensure that a community of users utilizes OSIRIS effectively and to its full potential. While anyone can freely access the open-source OSIRIS project without being a member of the OSIRIS Consortium, affiliated members can have access to additional support and development branches of OSIRIS beyond the public version.

The governance model of the OSIRIS Consortium is aligned with the best practices in open-source projects, following the model of the [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) open-source project.
